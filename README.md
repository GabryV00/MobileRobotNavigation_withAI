# MobileRobotNavigation with Artificial Intelligence techniques
In this repository there are several assignments of the course Mobile Robot Navigation with Artificial Intelligence techniques of the University of Klagenfurt.

## Image Classification
In this assignment, a small custom dataset was created, containing four classes of images (planes, drones, helicopters, birds).

In the models folder, you will find the notebooks in which the fine tuning of four pre-trained models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet18 and VGG-16) was done on the proposed dataset and the subsequent testing.

## Object Detection 
In this assignment, the dataset proposed for Image Classification was annotated, containing four classes of images (planes, drones, helicopters, birds).

In the models folder, you will find the notebooks in which the fine tuning of three pre-trained models (YOLOv8 and two versions of Faster R-CNN) was done on the proposed dataset and the subsequent testing.
